# Task ID: 8
# Title: Animation and Transition Effects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement subtle animations and transitions to enhance the mysterious, sleek aesthetic of the website.
# Details:
1. Add scroll-triggered animations for section entries
2. Implement hover effects for buttons and interactive elements
3. Create subtle background animations (e.g., particle effects for the void background)
4. Add transition effects between sections
5. Implement the glowing arrow line animation in the 'How It Works' section
6. Create subtle text animations for headings
7. Add loading animations for images
8. Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts
9. Make animations optional for users with reduced motion preferences

# Test Strategy:
Test animation performance across devices. Verify animations trigger correctly on scroll. Check that reduced motion preferences are respected. Ensure animations enhance rather than distract from content. Measure impact on page performance.
