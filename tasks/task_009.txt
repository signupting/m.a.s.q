# Task ID: 9
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize website performance for fast loading and smooth interactions.
# Details:
1. Optimize and compress all images (WebP format, appropriate sizes)
2. Implement lazy loading for images
3. Minimize CSS and JavaScript bundles
4. Implement code splitting for better initial load time
5. Add appropriate caching strategies
6. Optimize fonts loading (preload, font-display swap)
7. Reduce unnecessary re-renders in components
8. Optimize animations for performance
9. Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content
10. Set up performance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Measure load times before and after optimization. Use Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to verify improvements. Test on low-end devices and slow connections. Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS). Ensure optimizations don't break functionality.
